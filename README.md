# Holodex Portal

Small and simple extension that allows you to open currently watched video or a stream on the Holodex website. If used on a page that is not a YouTube video it will open HoloTools website in a new tab.

Forked to port from HoloTools to Holodex.

Works for Chrome only, I'll port to Firefox soon though. To install, download and unzip wherever. Go to 'chrome://extensions' and enable developer mode with the slider in the top right, press 'Load Unpacked' and select the directory titled 'src'.
